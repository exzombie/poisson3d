<h1>Solving the Poisson equation on a triclinic lattice</h1>
<address>
<a href="mailto:jure.varlec@ki.si">Jure Varlec</a>
</address>
<p>
  We are solving the Poisson equation, defined as

  \begin{equation} \nabla^2 \ph = \rho , \end{equation}

  on a 3-dimensional domain with periodic boundary conditions but a
  non-orthogonal coordinate system. The domain thus has the shape of a
  parallelepiped and is a unit cell of a periodic lattice. Both
  \(\rho\) and \(\ph\) are continuous scalar fields. The solution
  presented here is thus a solution of the problem of finding the
  electrostatic potential corresponding to a continuous charge
  distribution in a crystal. In principle, this method also solves the
  problem for point charges where \(\rho = \sum_i \delta (\vec{r} -
  \vec{r}_i)\), however, because domain discretization is employed, a
  very fine grid is required to obtain acceptable precision. It is
  thus recommended to use a different method for point charges, such
  as Ewald summation.
</p>

<h2>Non-orthogonal coordinates</h2>
<p>
  Let \(\m{B}\) be a \(3 \times 3\) matrix whose rows are the
  right-handed basis vectors defining our domain, i.e. they represent
  the edges of the parallelepiped. We then obtain the Cartesian
  coordinates of a point represented by a column-vector \(\m{r}\) from
  the vector of its fractional coordinates \(\m{f}\) as

  \begin{equation} \m{r} = \m{B}^T \m{f} \end{equation}

  where \(\m{B}^T\) is the transposed matrix. Similarly,

  \begin{equation}
    \m{f} = {\m{B}^T}^{-1} \m{r} = \m{Mr},
  \end{equation}

  where we introduced the shorthand \(\m{M}\) for the inverted
  matrix. Fractional coordinates (also called crystal coordinates)
  have values between 0 and 1 for points inside the domain.
</p>

<p>
  We assume \(\rho\) and \(\ph\) are defined in terms of fractional
  coordinates, which is the case when they are given as a set of
  values on a discrete grid, as is the case e.g. with charge
  distributions computed with quantum chemistry software. This means
  that \(\ph = \ph(\m{f}) = \ph(\m{Mr})\). Let us now derive the form
  that operator \(\nabla^2 = \sum_i \pd^2 / \pd r_i^2\) takes in this
  case. We begin by writing down the first derivative, using the
  Einstein summation rules:

  \begin{equation}
    \pdf{\ph}{r_i} = \pdf{\ph}{f_j} \pdf{f_j}{r_i} = \pdf{\ph}{f_j} M_{ji}
  \end{equation}

  arriving at

  \begin{equation}
    \nabla \ph = \m{B}^{-1} \pdf{\ph}{\m{f}}
  \end{equation}

  since \(f_i = M_{ij} r_j\). Taking the second derivative over the
  same coordinate as the first, we obtain

  \begin{equation}
    \pdf{}{r_i} \pdf{\ph}{r_i} = M_{ji}\pdf{^2\ph}{f_k \pd f_j} M_{ki}
    \label{eq:thepoisson}
  \end{equation}

  or, in matrix notation,

  \begin{equation}
    \nabla^2 \ph =
    \mathrm{tr} \left( \m{MM}^T\pdf{^2\ph}{\m{f}\pd\m{f}} \right)
  \end{equation}

  where \(\mathrm{tr}\) stands for the trace operator.

<h2>Solving on a regular grid</h2>
<p>
  A simple and well known way to solve the Poisson equation on a
  domain with straight boundaries in Cartesian coordinates is a direct
  solution in Fourier space where the differential equation becomes a
  simple per-point division of the transformed \(\rho\) by a phase
  term. As it turns out, a triclinic domain is amenable to the same
  treatment, albeit with a more complicated form of the phase term.
</p>
<p>
  Let the domain be discretized as a regular grid. Denoting the basis
  vectors (i.e. rows of the matrix \(\m{B}\)) as \(\m{a}_1\),
  \(\m{a}_2\) and \(\m{a}_3\), the Cartesian coordinates of a grid
  location are

  \begin{equation}
    \m{r}_{u, v, w} = \frac{u}{N_1} \m{a}_1
      + \frac{v}{N_2} \m{a}_2
      + \frac{w}{N_3} \m{a}_3
      = \m{B}^T \m{f}_{u,v,w}
  \label{eq:r}
  \end{equation}

  with \(u\), \(v\) and \(w\) being indices into the 3-dimensional
  array containing the values of a scalar field and \(N_1\), \(N_2\)
  and \(N_3\) being the number of grid points in each dimension. Each
  coefficient like \(u / N_1\) thus represents the discrete fractional
  coordinates of the grid point.

  We now replace the derivatives of the previous section with finite
  differences on a grid. In order to avoid complicating the
  expressions too much, we only consider derivatives over specific
  coordinates; it is easy to generalize from there. The first
  derivative over fractional coordinates in the direction of
  \(\m{a}_1\) is then

  \begin{equation}
    \pdf{\ph_{u,v,w}}{f_1} \to \frac{\ph_{u+1,v,w}
      - \ph_{u-1,v,w}}{2h_1}, \quad
      h_1 = \frac{1}{N_1},
  \end{equation}

  using the central difference which is symmetric and has higher order
  than left or right differences. From now on, we elide indices that
  are not significant in a particular expression, e.g. \(\ph_{u+1,v,w}
  \to \ph_{u+1}\) in the expression above. The second derivative in
  directions \(\m{a}_1\) and \(\m{a}_2\) becomes

  \begin{equation}
    \pdf{^2 \ph_{u,v}}{f_1\pd f_2} \to
      \frac{1}{4h_1h_2}\left[
      \ph_{u+1,v+1} + \ph_{u-1,v-1} - \ph_{u+1, v-1} - \ph_{u-1,v+1}
      \right]
  \label{eq:nondiagonal}
  \end{equation}

  This expression is different from the one obtained when both
  directions are the same, which is

  \begin{equation}
    \pdf{^2 \ph_{u}}{^2 f_1} \to
      \frac{1}{h_1^2}\left[
      \ph_{u+1} + \ph_{u-1} - 2\ph_u
    \right].
  \label{eq:simpleex}
  \end{equation}

  The operator \(\nabla^2\) now being defined as a finite difference
  operator, equation \eqref{eq:thepoisson} becomes a system of coupled
  linear equations.
</p>

<p>
  These equations can be decoupled by introducing the Fourier
  expansion of scalar fields:

  \begin{equation}
    \ph_{u,v,w} = \sum\limits_{U,V,W} \Phi_{U,V,W}
      e^{-2\pi\ii Uu/N_1} e^{-2\pi\ii Vv/N_2} \ee^{-2\pi\ii Ww/N_3}
  \label{eq:expansion}
  \end{equation}

  where each Fourier component is defined as

  \begin{equation}
  \Phi_{U,V,W} = \frac{1}{N_1N_2N_3} \sum\limits_{u,v,w} \ph_{u,v,w} 
      e^{2\pi\ii Uu/N_1} e^{2\pi\ii Vv/N_2} \ee^{2\pi\ii Ww/N_3}.
  \end{equation}

  This expression can be efficiently computed using a Fast Fourier
  Transform algorithm. Substituting expansion \eqref{eq:expansion}
  into, for example, the right side of equation \eqref{eq:simpleex},
  yields

  \begin{equation}
  \pdf{^2 \ph_{u}}{^2 f_1} \to
  \frac{1}{h_1^2} \sum\limits_{U,V,W} \Phi_{U,V,W}
  e^{-2\pi\ii Uu/N_1} e^{-2\pi\ii Vv/N_2} \ee^{-2\pi\ii Ww/N_3}
  \left(
  \ee^{-2\pi\ii U/N_1} + \ee^{+2\pi\ii U/N_1} - 2
  \right).
  \label{eq:simpleexf}
  \end{equation}

  It is now evident that the equations become decoupled in reciprocal
  space since each Fourier component is independently multiplied by
  the phase factor in parentheses. However, the notation used is
  cumbersome. Instead, we introduce reciprocal lattice vectors

  \begin{equation}
    \m{k}_i = 2\pi\frac{\m{a}_j \times
      \m{a}_k}{(\m{a}_1,\m{a}_2,\m{a}_3)}, \\
      \m{K}_{U,V,W} = U\m{k}_1 + V\m{k}_2 + W\m{k}_3
  \end{equation}

  for cyclical permutations of indices \((i,j,k)\), wherein equation
  \eqref{eq:expansion} becomes

  \begin{equation}
    \ph_{u,v,w} = \sum\limits_{U,V,W}\Phi_{U,V,W}
      \ee^{-\ii \m{r}_{u,v,w} \cdot \m{K}_{U,V,W}}
  \end{equation}

  since reciprocal lattice vectors have the property \(\m{k}_i \cdot
  \m{a}_j = 2\pi\delta_{ij}\). Using a shorthand \(\tilde{\m{a}}_i =
  \m{a}_i / N_i\), equation \eqref{eq:simpleexf} can now be written in
  a more general form

  \begin{equation}
  \pdf{^2 \ph_{u}}{^2 f_1} \to
  \frac{1}{h_1^2} \sum\limits_{U,V,W} \Phi_{U,V,W}
  \ee^{-\ii \m{r}_{u,v,w} \cdot \m{K}_{U,V,W}}
  \left(
  \ee^{-\ii \tilde{\m{a}}_i \cdot K_{U,V,W}}
  + \ee^{\ii \tilde{\m{a}}_i \cdot K_{U,V,W}}
  - 2
  \right)
  \end{equation}

  and similarly for equation \eqref{eq:nondiagonal}. To join both
  expressions, we define a factor

  \begin{equation}
  P^{i,j}_{U,V,W} = \left\{
  \begin{array}{lr}
  N_i^2
  \left(\ 
  \ee^{-\ii \tilde{\m{a}}_i \cdot K_{U,V,W}}
  + \ee^{\ii \tilde{\m{a}}_i \cdot K_{U,V,W}}
  - 2
  \ \right)
  & ; i = j \\

  \frac{N_i N_j}{4}
  \left(\ 
  \ee^{-\ii (\tilde{\m{a}}_i + \tilde{\m{a}}_j) \cdot K_{U,V,W}}
  + \ee^{\ii (\tilde{\m{a}}_i + \tilde{\m{a}}_j) \cdot K_{U,V,W}}
  - \ee^{-\ii (\tilde{\m{a}}_i - \tilde{\m{a}}_j) \cdot K_{U,V,W}}
  - \ee^{\ii (\tilde{\m{a}}_i - \tilde{\m{a}}_j) \cdot K_{U,V,W}}
  \ \right)
  & ; i \ne j
  \end{array}
  \right.
  \end{equation}

  This can be simplified further, yielding

  \begin{equation}
  P^{i,j}_{U,V,W} = \left\{
  \begin{array}{lr}
  2 N_i^2 \left( \cos \left[\tilde{\m{a}}_i \cdot \m{K}_{U,V,W} \right] - 1 \right)
  & ; i = j \\

  \frac{N_i N_j}{2}
  \left(
  \cos \left[\left(\tilde{\m{a}}_i + \tilde{\m{a}}_j \right) \cdot \m{K}_{U,V,W} \right]
  - \cos \left[\left(\tilde{\m{a}}_i - \tilde{\m{a}}_j \right) \cdot \m{K}_{U,V,W} \right]
  \right)
  & ; i \ne j
  \end{array}
  \right.
  \end{equation}  

  The transformed equation \eqref{eq:thepoisson} is then, using again
  Einstein summation rules,

  \begin{equation}
  \Phi_{U,V,W} M_{ji} M_{ki} P^{k,j}_{U,V,W} = \xi_{U,V,W}
  \end{equation}

  with \(\xi\) being the Fourier transform of \(\rho\). This set of
  equations can be solved simply by dividing each of the values of
  \(\xi\) with the corresponding factor.

</p>
<p>
  An exception must be made for the zero-frequency component
  \(\xi_{0,0,0}\) since the corresponding phase factor is zero which
  blows up the solution. Thus, \(\Phi_{0,0,0}\) must explicitly be set
  to zero or, alternatively, an arbitrary finite value. There are
  physical reasons for this. Considering the example of
  electrostatics, the electrostatic potential is only defined up to an
  additive constant, meaning that its average value over the domain
  (corresponding to the zero-frequency component) is
  arbitrary. Secondly, the net charge (sum of \(\rho\)) must be zero
  because the system is periodic and infinite. If this is not so,
  setting \(\xi_{0,0,0}\) to zero simply subtracts the average,
  embedding the charged system in a constant oppositely charged
  background, which is as much as can be done.
